\description{
This data set comes with the ggplot2 package.
It contains a subset of the fuel economy data that the EPA makes available on
https://fueleconomy.gov/. It contains only models which had a new
release every year between 1999 and 2008 - this was used as a proxy for the
popularity of the car.
